PROBLEM STATEMENT:  1. Prepare an article/slides on JPA and hibernate and how to preform CRUD operations using it
2. Setup a new Spring application and write APIs for performing basic CRUD operations as per the given instructions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:

Briefly introduce the topic of Java Persistence API (JPA) and its significance in Java-based applications.
Mention that JPA is a specification for managing relational data in Java applications and provides a set of interfaces and annotations for mapping Java objects to database tables.
Overview of the Todo Entity Class:

Explain that the Todo class is an entity class representing tasks in a todo list.
Highlight the annotations used in the class (@Entity, @Table, @Id, @GeneratedValue, and @Column) and their roles in mapping the class to a database table.
Emphasize that these annotations provide metadata for Hibernate (the JPA implementation) to map Java objects to corresponding database tables and columns.
Annotations Used in the Todo Class:

@Entity: Indicates that the class is a JPA entity and will be managed by the JPA provider.
@Table: Specifies the name of the database table to which this entity is mapped.
@Id: Denotes the primary key of the entity.
@GeneratedValue: Specifies the generation strategy for the primary key values.
@Column: Defines the mapping between entity attributes and table columns.
Explanation of Entity Attributes:

Discuss each attribute in the Todo class (id, todo, status, priority) and their corresponding database columns.
Explain that id is the primary key generated automatically using identity-based strategy.
Describe todo, status, and priority as regular attributes mapped to respective database columns.
Methods and Additional Functionality:

Mention that constructors, getters, setters, and other methods are omitted for brevity but are essential for the class's functionality.
Optionally, briefly discuss any additional methods or functionality specific to the Todo class, such as custom business logic or validation.




To explain the CRUD operations for a todo list API using the provided JSON data in a video, you can follow these steps:

Introduction:

Start by introducing the topic of building a todo list API.
Briefly explain the purpose of the video, which is to demonstrate how to implement CRUD operations for managing todo items.
Overview of JSON Data:

Display the JSON data structure that represents a todo item.
Explain each attribute in the JSON data (id, todo, priority, status) and its significance in the todo list application.
API Endpoints:

Present each API endpoint one by one:
GET /todos: Retrieve all todo items.
POST /todos: Create a new todo item.
GET /todos/{id}: Retrieve a specific todo item by its ID.
PUT /todos/{id}: Update a todo item.
DELETE /todos/{id}: Delete a todo item.
Code Implementation:

Walk through the code implementation of each API endpoint using a code editor or IDE.
Explain how to use Spring Boot and Spring MVC to create RESTful APIs.
Discuss the controller methods, service layer, and repository interfaces/classes involved in handling CRUD operations.
Demonstration:

Show a practical demonstration of each API endpoint using tools like Postman or cURL.
Execute requests to retrieve, create, update, and delete todo items.
Display the corresponding responses for each request.

1.GET Request (Retrieve Data):

In JPA with Hibernate, fetching data from the database involves querying entities using JPA repository methods.
To implement a GET endpoint, you would typically define a controller method that handles HTTP GET requests and uses a JPA repository to fetch data from the database.


Example:
java
Copy code
@GetMapping("/todos")
public ResponseEntity<List<Todo>> getAllTodos() {
    List<Todo> todos = todoRepository.findAll();
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(todos);
}


2.POST Request (Create Data):

For creating new records in the database, you would handle POST requests and use JPA repository methods to save entities.
In the controller, you would receive the data from the request body, create a new entity object, and save it using the JPA repository's save method.

Example:
java
Copy code
@PostMapping("/todos")
public ResponseEntity<Todo> createTodo(@RequestBody Todo todo) {
    Todo savedTodo = todoRepository.save(todo);
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.CREATED).body(savedTodo);
}


3.PUT Request (Update Data):

Updating existing records involves handling PUT requests and modifying the data in the database.
In the controller, you would receive the updated data along with the entity ID, fetch the corresponding entity from the database, update its fields, and save it back.


Example:
java
Copy code
@PutMapping("/todos/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Todo> updateTodo(@PathVariable("id") int id, @RequestBody Todo updatedTodo) {
    Todo existingTodo = todoRepository.findById(id)
                                      .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Todo not found with id: " + id));
    existingTodo.setTodo(updatedTodo.getTodo());
    existingTodo.setStatus(updatedTodo.getStatus());
    existingTodo.setPriority(updatedTodo.getPriority());
    Todo updatedTodo = todoRepository.save(existingTodo);
    return ResponseEntity.ok().body(updatedTodo);
}

4.DELETE Request (Delete Data):

Deleting records involves handling DELETE requests and removing the data from the database.
In the controller, you would receive the entity ID to be deleted, fetch the corresponding entity from the database, and delete it using the JPA repository's deleteById method.
Example:
java
Copy code
@DeleteMapping("/todos/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Void> deleteTodo(@PathVariable("id") int id) {
    todoRepository.deleteById(id);
    return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();
}
In all these examples, todoRepository represents a JPA repository interface that extends JpaRepository<T, ID>, where T is the entity type (Todo in this case) and ID is the type of the entity's primary key (Integer in this case). These repository interfaces provide methods for CRUD operations out of the box. Additionally, exception handling can be added to handle cases such as entity not found or data validation errors.
